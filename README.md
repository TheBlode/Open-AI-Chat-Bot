# Open AI Chat Bot
Are you sick of being bombarded with ads while browsing on Amazon? Me too. That's why I wrote this Chrome Extension! This Extension will hide a lot of the advertisements and invasive elements on Amazon listings to allow you to create a focused shopping experience showing you only the most pertinent information; product information and product reviews. I hope you find this Extension useful!

# Pre-requisites
- You'll need to running PHP 7+. You may run tweak the code to work with earlier versions if you wish.
- You'll need to install NodeJS on your system (this is required for the OpenAI communication).
- You'll need an API key to use this frontend.

# Installation
- Clone the repository using `git`, Github Desktop or download the repository as a zip file.
- Extract the archive contents to your PHP folder (on Linux it is usually /var/www/html/ and on XAMPP for Windows it's usually C:\xampp\htdocs\ )
- Grab your OpenAI API key and add it to "api_key.txt". I don't provide an api key as it's not free.
- Open up your browser, navigate to your site...and enjoy chatting!
